# Pulsar

Pulsar is an application layer on top of the Mina Protocol using the Cosmos SDK, designed and built by the node101 team. It is currently under exploration and PoC level, and we hope to release it under public testnet in a couple of months' time. Some important points are:

1. It is designed as a restake chain (probably on top of ATOM, not finalized yet).
2. It performs periodic proving of all consensus related activity through o1js proofs.
3. It settles on Mina to keep the chain history succinct.
4. It is backed by the consumer chain's economic security for any on-chain activity.
5. It is backed by Mina's economic security for historical availability and succinctness of the chain.

In short, it is designed as a side-chain for Mina for fast throughput zkApps.

Archive-wrapper is a mandatory runtime dependency for validator startup. See
[Archive-wrapper deployment](docs/archive-wrapper-deployment.md) for the supported
shared, per-validator, and external topologies.

For a reproducible local Mina Lightnet, archive-wrapper, and multi-validator
Pulsar environment, see
[Local Lightnet deployment](docs/local-lightnet-deployment.md).
